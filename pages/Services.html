            <p>Is no secret that the mining industry is one of the mayor reasons of the quick spread of Oripathy, and to try to cut the problem at its root, we entered in this field with firm hand. Thanks to the size of our landship and the expertise of our team of proffesional geologist and engineers, we count with advanced mineral extraction devices and facilities that, alongside diverse contracts with local goverments and mining companies, alough us to hold a competitive position in the field on top of giving us the oportunity to impart the adequate saffety measures when mining and handling crude Originium and its byproducts to our partners and producing part the fuel required to operate our sistems has a byproduct.</p>

            <p>Those wo suffer from Oripathy are summited to osthrasition and alienation, this has been the norm for far too long and we believe that the moment to bring change is now. That said, with how deep this hatred has buried its roots in our society is natural that many will resist to this change. To avoid damage to our patients, facilities and colaborators, Rhodes Island poses its own private military force highly trained and dispatched in every one of our branches and hospitals to ensure the safety of our facilities, employees and patients.</p>
